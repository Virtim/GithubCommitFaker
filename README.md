# GitHub Commit faker

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circleci-docs.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Virtim/GithubCommitFaker/)

This is a simple CircleCI config to make it look like you're cool developer and commit a lot and often. In reality it will make empty commit and don't change anything. This is useless. Think twice before using it. Why would you do it to yourself?
